* Chris, a zsh theme for prezto

** Screenshot
in the works...
** Compatibility
Unfortunately you will likely need a patched powerline font, I use[[https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode][ Fira Code]], which also has fancy ligatures. I have also used[[https://github.com/powerline/fonts/tree/master/DejaVuSansMono][ Deja Vu Sans Mono for Powerline]] which is also very good.

** Install
the install script just makes a hard link to the correct directory in the zprezto directory. I would prefer a symbolic link, however prezto did not like that
