** Compatibility
Unfortunately you will likely need a patched powerline font, I use[[https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode][ Fira Code]], which also has fancy ligatures. I have also used[[https://github.com/powerline/fonts/tree/master/DejaVuSansMono][ Deja Vu Sans Mono for Powerline]] which is also very good.
